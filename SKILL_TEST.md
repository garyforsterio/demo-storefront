# Mercari frontend skill test

## Graphical elements

No graphical elements are provided. Please feel free to use any Free or Open Source resources to create the best user experience you can think of.

The design specification provides the minimum level of details. You can add more if you think it will add more value to the product, but there should not be a divergence from the provided design specification. For example, if a "Like" icon is a heart, it should stay a heart.

## Technology stack

In Mercari, we use the React framework for most of our frontend code. Please use either React or vanilla JavaScript to do the assignment.

Rather than seeing your ability to use a particular tool, we want to see that you can write good code.

## Minimum requirements

1. The default view for the application is the Item List page.
2. When an Item on the Item List page is clicked, the application should navigate to the Item Detail page.
3. It should be possible to navigate directly to an Item Detail page by URL.
4. Implement the Item List page according to the specification.
5. Implement the Item Details page according to the specification.
6. Please use the provided [API](./API.md).
7. Please do not use any boilerplate such as `create-react-app`.
8. Please use English for communication, commit messages and comments.
